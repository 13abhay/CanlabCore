CanlabCore
==========

This repository contains core tools for MRI/fMRI/PET analysis from the Cognitive and Affective Neuorscience Lab (Tor Wager, PI) and our collaborators.  Many of these functions are needed to run other toolboxes, e.g., the CAN lab’s multilevel mediation and Martin Lindquist’s hemodynamic response estimation toolboxes.

We have several sources of documentation:

A brief introduction to the toolbox can be found <a href = "http://canlab.github.io/CanlabCore">here</a>.

Additional documentation for some toolboxes, WIKI pages on fMRI analysis, and fMRI references can be found on the <a href = "http://wagerlab.colorado.edu/wiki/doku.php/help/fmri_tools_documentation">CANlab wiki</a>.

For function-by-function help documents on the Core Tools objects and functions, see the <a href = http://canlabcore.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>help pages on Readthedocs</a>.

Code walk-throughs of some core functionality are in the <a href='https://github.com/canlab/CANlab_help_examples'>CANlab_help_examples github repository</a>
