CanlabCore
==========

This repository contains core tools for MRI/fMRI/PET analysis from the Cognitive and Affective Neuorscience Lab (Tor Wager, PI) and our collaborators.  Many of these functions are needed to run other toolboxes, e.g., the CAN lab’s multilevel mediation and Martin Lindquist’s hemodynamic response estimation toolboxes. A brief introduction to the toolbox can be found <a href = "http://canlab.github.io/CanlabCore">here</a>.  

The CANlab website is https://canlabweb.colorado.edu/, and we also maintain a WIKI with more information on some of our toolboxes and fMRI analysis more generally, which is <a href = "https://canlabweb.colorado.edu/wiki/doku.php/help/fmri_tools_documentation">here</a>.  For more information on fMRI analysis generally, see <a href = "https://leanpub.com/principlesoffmri">Martin and Tor's online book</a> and our free Coursera videos and classes <a href = "https://www.coursera.org/learn/functional-mri">Principles of fMRI Part 1</a> and <a href = "https://www.coursera.org/learn/functional-mri-2">Part 2 </a>.

We have several sources of documentation for this toolbox:

1.  For a walk-through of a common basic processing pipeline, see our <a href='https://canlabreposguide.hackpad.com/CANLab-Repository-Guide-aGTiWJr0zbt'>hackpad</a>
2.  For function-by-function help documents on the Core Tools objects and functions, see the <a href = http://canlabcore.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>help pages on Readthedocs</a>.
3.  For brief, documented code examples of some specific functions, and a batch script system that uses the CanlabCore object-oriented tools for second-level neuroimaging analysis, see <a href='https://github.com/canlab/CANlab_help_examples'>CANlab_help_examples github repository</a>
